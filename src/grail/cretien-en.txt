If you sow lightly, you reap
Lightly. And a good crop
Requires the kind ofsoil
Where seeds sprout a hundred
Fold, for even good seed
Dies in dried-up ground.
What Chretien sows-the seeds
He scatters- are the start of a story,
And he plants his words in such
Fine soil that he's bound to do well,
Because he's telling his tale
For the noblest man in the Holy
Roman Empire, Philip
Of Flanders- since despite the good things
They say of Alexander,
Count Philip is better, and I
Can prove it, for Alexander
Acquired all the evils
And vices of which the count
Was either free or innocent.
The count permits no vulgar
Joking, no wicked words,
And is pained by malicious prattle
Of anyone, no matter who.
He's fond of even-tempered
Justice, and good faith, and the Church,
And despises everything immoral.
His giving reaches in every
Direction, but no one knows
How far, for he gives without guile
Or greed, as Matthew said,
The left hand unaware
What the right hand does, hidden
Except from those who receive it
And from God, who sees our secrets
And can read our hearts and our bellies.
Why else does the Gospel say:
"Hide your good deeds from your left hand"?
The left hand, according to this
Tradition, is pompous pride,
Hypocritical and false.
And what does the right hand mean?
Charity, which never
Boasts, but conceals its goodness,
Lets no one know except Him
We call both God and Charity.
For God is Charity, and all
Who give with good hearts (Saint Paul
Has written, and I've read his words)
Live in God and God is
In them. The truth is plain:
Count Philip's good deeds amount
To the purest of pure charity,
For no one knows what he's given,
Or to whom, except his noble
Heart, which prompts his giving.
Would it be better to act
Like Alexander, indifferent
To charity, closed to goodness?
But no one believes such nonsense!
Chretien's labors, the pains
He's taken, at the count's express
Command, to properly tell
This story (the best ever told
At the king's great court), will be worth
His struggles. It's the story of the Grail,*
From a book the count gave me:
And here's how Chretien told it.
The season was spring, trees
Were sprouting leaves, meadows
Were green, every morning
Birds sang in their own
Sweet language, and the world was joyful.
And the son of the widowed lady
Living alone in the Barren
Forest rose, and quickly
Saddled his hunting horse
For himself, took three wooden
Spears and, thus equipped,
Rode away from his mother's
House, intending to check
On the plowmen sowing oats
In his mother's fields, a dozen
Oxen pulling six
Great plows. He entered the forest,
And the heart deep inside him
Leapt with joy at the sweet
Season and the happy sound
Of birds singing from trees
All around. Everything pleased him.
To savor this peaceful moment
He slipped the bridle from his horse's
Head, letting him graze
In the fresh green grass, then played
With the wooden spears he could throw
So well, hurling some
Behind him, some in front,
Some high in the air,
Then down, and up, and down
Again-until he heard
Five knights, all fully armed,
Riding through the forest
And making an immense racket
As, over and over, branches
Of oak trees and elms clattered
Against the heavy metal.
Mail shirts clinked and clanked,
Spears banged on shields
And in shields and armor wood
Creaked and iron rang.
The boy could hear but could
Not see who was coming so quickly.
Stunned, he said to himself,
"By my soul, my mother was right,
Saying that in all the world
There was nothing so fearsome as devils!
And to teach me how to behave
She told me to cross myself
When I see them. But that's too much
To ask: instead of crossing
Myself I'll stick the biggest
And strongest with one of these wooden
Spears, and none of the others
Will come anywhere near me! "
That's what he said to himself
Before he could see them. But once
They came into view, emerging
From the forest that hid them, and he saw
Their gleaming mail shirts and bright,
Shining helmets, and such shields
And spears as he'd never seen
In all his life, with their gleaming
Colors, green and purple,
Gold and blue and silver,
Lit by the sun, they seemed to him
Wonderfully handsome and good.
And he said, "0 God, forgive me!
I see angels here
In front of me! I sinned against You
What wickedness I spoke! -
When I called them devils. Those weren't
Fairy tales my mother
Told me, saying that except
For God Himself angels
Were the loveliest creatures in existence.
But that one, I think, who seems
So lovely that none of the others
Boasts a tenth of his beauty,
That one must be God.
And hasn't my mother told me
That God must be loved and adored,
Honored and implored, bowed down to?
I will adore that one,
And all the angels with him."
So he threw himself down
On the ground, and knelt, chanting
Every prayer he knew
(Taught him by his mother). And seeing
How he prayed, the leader of the knights
Called out: "Stop! Wait!
This boy, seeing us coming,
Has fallen to the ground in fright.
Should we come riding at him,
All together, I think
He's likely to die of fear
And a corpse won't be able
To answer a thing I ask."
So the others stopped, and their leader
Hurried forward, greeting
The boy with reassuring
Words: "Don't be afraid,
Fellow!" "By the God I believe in,"
Said the boy, "I'm not. Are you
God?" "Hardly, by my faith."
"Then what are you?" "A knight."
"I've never met a knight,"
Said the boy, "and I've never seen one,
Or spoken with one, or heard one
But you're more beautiful than God.
I wish I could be like you
Shining, just like you! "
At this, the knight came closer
To the boy, and asked, "Have you seen
Five knights and three young girls
Today, anywhere near here?"
But the boy had other things
On his mind, and other questions
To ask. Grasping the knight's
Spear, he said, "Your beautiful
Lordship, known as a knight:
What's this you're carrying here?"
"I'm not learning much
From this fellow," said the knight. "That's clear.
My dear young friend, I'm seeking
Information from you
And you're asking the questions!
All right, I'll tell you. It's my spear."
"You mean," said the boy, "you spear things
With this, as I do with my sticks?"
"Good lord, what a fool you are!
It isn't for throwing, but striking."
"Then anyone of my sticks
See them, right there? - is better
Than this. When I want to kill
A bird, or maybe an animal,
I do it from as far away
As a crossbow arrow can carry."
"I really don't care," said the knight.
"Now answer the question I asked you:
Do you know where those knights have gone?
Have you seen the girls I'm seeking?"
Taking hold of the shield,
The boy asked, bluntly,
"What do you use this for?"
"What kind of game is this?
You set me all sorts of questions
And never answer mine!
In the name of God, I expected
Answers from you, not questions:
You act as if I'm your teacher!
Well, no matter, I'll tell you
Anyway: I want you to be pleased.
This thing I'm carrying is a shield."
"It's called a shield?" "Exactly.
And it's not to be despised,
Believe me: it's been a faithful
Friend, stopping any
Arrow or spear that tries
To hurt me. It stops them all
And that's why I carry this shield."
Then those who'd been hanging back,
Waiting for their chief, came hurrying
Up the road, asking him
Anxiously, "My lord, what
On earth is this Welshman telling you?"
"As God is my witness, his wits
Are distinctly scattered. Whatever
I ask him, point blank, he answers
Sideways, and off the mark,
Asking the names of things
And how they're used." "My lord,
Believe me, the Welsh can't help it:
They're all born like that,
Crazy as cows in a pasture.
And this one's dumb as an ox.
It's silly to stop for him,
Letting him babble away
And wasting precious time."
"I'm not so sure," said their chief.
"May God look down on me, now!
Before we ride on our way
I'll tell him whatever he wants,
And I won't ride on till I do."
He turned to the boy once more:
"Fellow," he said, "please,
Just tell me: did you meet those five knights,
And the girls I asked you about?
Did you see them riding by?"
The boy took hold of his mail shirt
And gave it a tug. "Tell me,
Good sir," he said, "what's this
You're wearing?" "You really don't know?"
"Not at all." "This is my mail shirt:
It's just as heavy as iron."
"Is it made of iron?" "See
For yourself." "I really don't know.
But how lovely it is, God save me!
Why do you wear it? What
